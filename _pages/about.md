This is Dr. Ahmet Diril's home on the web! He is a fine citizen of Turkey who studied Physics, got his PhD in Physics and worked 18 years in a metrology research lab. Currently he is a freelance English-Turkish translator and a self-taught student of Programming, Data Science, AI and ML. He knows Python and JavaScript and he wants to be able to create self-contained websites focused on e-learning, natural language processing, AI aided translation and maybe some killer games. He was a dinosaur who used to play MUD in the old days and still misses all that adrenaline.
